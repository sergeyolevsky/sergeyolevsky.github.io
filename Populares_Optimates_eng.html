    </section>

    <article>

      <p>It often feels as if modern politics is unprecedented: two camps, two realities, two systems of meaning that no longer recognize one another. Yet when we step back and examine the structure of the conflict, it becomes clear that this is not new at all. It is a recurring mechanism.</p>

      <p>The late <span class="entity">Roman Republic</span> operated under a similar logic. There, too, existed two major political poles: the populares and the optimates. Though they cannot be directly mapped onto modern parties, their struggle mirrors what we see today — a contest not of policy details, but of who controls the system itself.</p>

      <p><b>The populares</b> appealed to the people — the poor, veterans, debtors, those who felt the system no longer served them. <b>The optimates</b> defended the senate, tradition, aristocratic privilege, and institutional continuity. This was not a disagreement about budgets. It was a dispute about who had the right to define the rules of power.</p>

      <p>Such conflicts rarely allow for moderation. When the issue is control of the system, moral language becomes a weapon.</p>

      <p>Yet even the most polarized systems sometimes experience moments when survival overrides ideology. For Rome, this moment came with the slave uprising led by <span class="entity">Spartacus</span> (73–71 BCE).</p>

      <p>The idea that tens of thousands of slaves could defeat Roman legions and threaten the very foundations of the state shocked the elite. It was a crisis that could not be solved through rhetoric or procedural maneuvering.</p>

      <p>At this point, what looks like reconciliation occurs: rival factions temporarily coordinate. But this is not peace. It is a ceasefire imposed by fear.</p>

      <p>The suppression of the revolt brought together two competing figures — <span class="entity">Marcus Licinius Crassus</span> and <span class="entity">Gnaeus Pompeius</span>. They represented different power networks and personal ambitions, yet the existential nature of the threat forced cooperation.</p>

      <p>
        The Roman logic was simple:<br>
        • eliminate the common danger first,<br>
        • return to internal struggle later.
      </p>

      <p>And that is precisely what happened. Victory did not lead to unity. Instead, it intensified rivalries. The title of “savior of the Republic” became a political currency.</p>

      <p>This is the enduring lesson: a common enemy can suspend internal conflict, but it rarely heals it. It merely postpones the reckoning.</p>

      <p>Why? Because such divisions are rarely about specific crises. They are about fundamental questions: who holds power, who controls resources, what is considered legitimate, and where the boundary lies between law and order.</p>

      <p>The Spartacus revolt did not destroy Rome. It revealed a system that could only function through emergency unity. Once the emergency ended, the underlying fractures reasserted themselves.</p>

      <p>What followed were new crises, new coalitions, and eventually civil wars and the transition to imperial rule. The Republic did not collapse because of Spartacus. It collapsed because it could no longer resolve its internal contradictions.</p>

      <p>Today, we see a similar rhythm. External threats prompt calls for unity and temporary coalitions. But once the danger fades, polarization returns — often with greater intensity.</p>

      <p>If history teaches anything, it is this: <b>existential threats can unite elites only temporarily</b>. Lasting stability requires shared rules that bind all sides, including the victors.</p>

      <p>Without such rules, the cycle repeats: fear, mobilization, victory, renewed struggle. The populares and optimates are not ancient curiosities. They are a recurring political matrix.</p>
