    <h1>Socialism and the Market: Why the “Nordic Model” Is Not Socialism</h1>
    <p class="date">November 2025</p>

    <p>
      It is common to hear the phrase: “Socialism is beautiful in theory.”
      It promises fairness, equality and security. Yet historical practice shows a consistent pattern:
      when socialism is implemented as an economic system, it leads to shortages, stagnation, and reduced freedom.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Socialism Was Actually Implemented</h2>
    <p>
      The USSR, Eastern Europe, Cuba, Venezuela, Cambodia under Pol Pot — all attempted to replace market mechanisms
      with centralized allocation. The outcome was the same: without market incentives, economies stagnate,
      innovation disappears, and productivity declines.
    </p>

    <h2>But What About Sweden, Norway, Denmark?</h2>
    <p>
      These countries are often cited as “successful socialist examples”.
      But in reality they are <b>capitalist market economies</b> with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>private property;</li>
      <li>entrepreneurship and competition;</li>
      <li>global trade integration;</li>
      <li>high but transparent taxation funding strong public services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      What is called the “Nordic model” is actually <b>capitalism with redistribution</b>.
      Its success depends on strong institutions, cultural trust, rule of law,
      and high levels of human capital — not central planning.
    </p>

    <h2>The Core Difference</h2>

    <p><b>Socialism</b> seeks to replace the market with centralized planning.<br>
    The <b>Nordic model</b> relies on the market to create wealth, and redistributes a portion of it.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The gap between the “socialist ideal” and the “Nordic reality” is fundamental.
      One tried to control the economy — and stalled.
      The other uses the market and invests in social cohesion.
