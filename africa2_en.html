  <article>

    <p>Almost all personal messages I receive after publishing anything about Africa come down to one question:</p>

    <p><i>“Everything is clear… but what exactly did you do there in practice? How?”</i></p>

    <p>The answer is simple: <b>we just lived there</b>. We were not visiting “on assignment,” we were not trying to preserve some Moscow distance — we became part of Nigeria. And that feeling never fully leaves you, even when writing these lines from Moscow.</p>

   <h2>20 years of relationships and observations that shaped my view</h2>

    <p><b>Wale Tinubu.</b> When he came to Moscow in the early 2000s at our team’s invitation, he was already the head of his company — a fully independent executive with ambition.  
    Yet within Nigeria’s political environment at the time, he was still perceived primarily as the brother of the Lagos State governor.  
    Today, he is the brother of the President — and the head of the same company.</p>

    <p><b>Mohammed Bello.</b> Supplied us with equipment for the mining project. Later became a senator from Kano State.</p>

    <p><b>Mohammed Audu.</b> When we met, he was “the son of the Kogi State governor.” Today he is an independent federal-level political figure.</p>

    <p><b>Innocent Okpadille.</b> Sadly, he is no longer with us. He supported us, supplied missing volumes of concentrate, and later became one of the major exporters and a regional developer.  
    Innocent was a remarkable person: once we arrived at his house for a meeting, the staff knew us and let us in — and we simply followed the sound of a saxophone. He was standing in the living room, playing.</p>

    <p><b>Marshal Ibrahim Alfa.</b> Also, unfortunately, has passed away. The first Marshal of the Nigerian Air Force. In the 1980s he trained at Baikonur and was meant to become the first African astronaut to fly aboard Soyuz.  
    He was not only a good friend — he genuinely helped us. He facilitated high-level reception in Nigeria for guests from Kazakhstan’s Ulba Metallurgical Plant.  
    And once, he even arranged a personal meeting for us with the President of neighbouring Niger.  
    I was just in my early twenties — it was a funny and slightly surreal experience.</p>

    <p><b>Mahmood Santuraki.</b> He began as aide-de-camp to General Babangida, later headed Nigeria’s equivalent of the economic crime unit. Then retired.  
    We had a joint company together: <b>Arewa Mining</b> (“Arewa” in Hausa means “Northern Nigeria”).</p>

    <p><b>Shandy (Peter).</b> Once a small-scale concentrate middleman. Today — a notable trader and developer.</p>

    <p><b>Gbenga.</b> Shifted to hospitality and is now a restaurateur in Lagos. Also active in public life — the status of a prince obliges.</p>

    <p><b>Generals Babangida and Obasanjo.</b> As twenty years ago, they remain moral authorities and continue to influence the political climate.</p>

    <p><b>Aliko Dangote.</b> Then — the wealthiest man in Nigeria. Now — the same. African time flows differently: much changes, much stays the same.</p>

    <p><b>Pascal Dozie.</b> Passed away this year. But already 25 years ago he was a prominent banker. His Diamond Bank financed our project.</p>

    <h2>Nigeria is kind to those who come for the long term</h2>

    <p>Once, when the Lukoil team was just beginning to work with Oranto, I shared my experience with a young woman who was preparing to fly to Lagos. She asked me:</p>

    <p><i>“How do you avoid getting malaria in Nigeria?”</i></p>

    <p>A naïve question. I had malaria five or six times — it’s inevitable if you work “in the field.” So I answered sarcastically:</p>

    <p><i>“Very simple: don’t leave the hotel and don’t turn off the air conditioner.”</i></p>

    <p>And she replied:</p>

    <p><i>“Of course I won’t leave the hotel.”</i></p>

    <p>That’s the whole lesson:  
    <b>You cannot be a tourist in Nigeria.  
    People respect those who come seriously — and for the long term.</b></p>
