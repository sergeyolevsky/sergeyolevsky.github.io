  <article>

<p>Almost all personal messages I receive after writing about Africa come down to one question:</p>

<p><i>"Everything is clear… but what exactly did you do in practice? How?"</i></p>

<p>The answer is simple: <b>we just lived there</b>. We didn’t come “on short assignments,” we didn’t try to maintain Moscow distance — we became part of Nigeria. And that feeling doesn’t disappear even now, when I’m writing these lines from Moscow.</p>

<h2>20 years of connections that shaped my perspective</h2>

<p><b>Wale Tinubu.</b> When he came to Moscow in the early 2000s at the invitation of our team, he was already the head of the company — a full-fledged leader and a man with ambition.  
But in the perception of the Nigerian political environment of that time, he was still seen primarily as the brother of the Lagos State governor.  
Today he is the brother of the President of the country and the head of the same company.</p>

<p><b>Mohammed Bello.</b> Supplied us with equipment for the mining project. Later became a Senator of Kano State.</p>

<p><b>Mohammed Audu.</b> When we met, he was known simply as “the son of the Governor of Kogi State.” Today he is an independent federal-level political figure.</p>

<p><b>Innocent Okpadille.</b> Sadly, he is no longer with us. He supported us, supplied missing volumes of concentrate, and later became one of the largest exporters and a regional developer.  
Innocent was a special person: once we arrived at his house for a meeting, the staff recognized us and let us in — and we simply followed the sound of a saxophone. He was standing in the living room playing.</p>

<p><b>Marshal Ibrahim Alfa.</b> Also gone. The first Air Marshal of the Nigerian Air Force. In the 1980s, he trained at Baikonur and was expected to become the first African cosmonaut to fly on a Soviet Soyuz.</p>

<p><b>Mahmud Santuraki.</b> Began as aide-de-camp to General Babangida, later headed Nigeria’s analogue of the Soviet OBKhSS (economic crimes unit). After retirement, we had a joint company together: <b>Arewa Mining</b> (“Arewa” in Hausa means “Northern Nigeria”).</p>

<p><b>Shandy (Peter).</b> Once a small-scale wholesale dealer of concentrate. Today — a notable trader and developer.</p>

<p><b>Gbenga.</b> Switched careers and is now a restaurateur in Lagos. Also active in public life — his status as a prince comes with obligations.</p>

<p><b>Generals Babangida and Obasanjo.</b> Just like 20 years ago, they remain moral authorities and still influence the political climate of the country.</p>

<p><b>Aliko Dangote.</b> Back then — the richest man in Nigeria. Today — the same. African time flows differently: much changes, much stays the same.</p>

<p><b>Pascal Dozie.</b> Passed away this year. But even 25 years ago he was already one of the prominent bankers. His Diamond Bank financed our project.</p>

<h2>Nigeria is kind to those who come for the long term</h2>

<p>Once, when the Lukoil team was just beginning work with Oranto, I was sharing my experience with a young woman who was supposed to fly to Lagos. She asked me:</p>

<p><i>— How do you avoid getting malaria in Nigeria?</i></p>

<p>It was a naïve question. I had malaria five or six times — it’s inevitable if you work “in the field.” So I answered sarcastically:</p>

<p><i>— Very simple: don’t leave the hotel and don’t turn off the air conditioner.</i></p>

<p>And she replied:</p>

<p><i>— Of course I won’t leave the hotel.</i></p>

<p>And that’s the whole secret:<br>
<b>You cannot be a tourist in Nigeria.<br>
Nigeria respects those who come seriously — and who come for the long term.</b></p>
