    <p>
      Born in Moscow, Sergei played hockey for the junior team of <b>Moscow Spartak</b>,
      and later for the student team of <b>Lakefield College School</b> (Canada),
      as well as the town team of <b>Lakefield, Ontario</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      He worked with several Russian payment systems and companies and was part of an expert group assisting the
      <b>Central Bank of Russia</b> in drafting the national <b>Payment Systems Act (Federal Law 161-FZ)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sergei has more than 15 years of experience in international payments and cross-border finance.
      He worked with <b>Transfast</b> (later acquired by <b>Mastercard</b>) and advised
      <b>Earthport</b> (former <b>IFC World Bank</b> equity entity, now operating as <b>Visa Direct</b>),
      focusing on payment infrastructure, compliance, and global settlements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Educated in the United States and Canada, and a participant in programs at the <b>Oxford Saïd Business School</b>,
      he has been involved in developing projects across the CIS, the Middle East, and Africa —
      including the establishment of a <b>columbite (Nb-Ta)</b> mining project in Nigeria.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, Sergei works at the intersection of technology, payments, and geo-economics,
      exploring new approaches to international settlements and global development strategies.

        <p class="date">May 2025</p>
        <p>SWIFT is not a money transfer system but a secure global messaging network between banks. Being disconnected from it means changing the channel, not losing access to the world.</p>

        <h2><a href="sanctions_en.html">Sanctions and Financial Restrictions</a></h2>
        <p class="date">June 2025</p>
        <p>Sanctions have become a permanent instrument of global politics. Frequency of use does not make them more effective — design and enforcement do.</p>

        <h2><a href="miscoding_en.html">International Payments and Miscoding</a></h2>
        <p class="date">July 2025</p>
        <p>Miscoding — the deliberate misclassification of payment categories — has become a key adaptation tool in global transactions under sanctions and compliance pressure.</p>

        <h2><a href="africa_en.html">Working in Africa</a></h2>
        <p class="date">October 2025</p>
        <p>Africa is not just a continent of opportunity — it is a continent of deep traditions and local authority. Success in Nigeria depends on understanding its power structures, tribal balance, and unwritten rules of partnership.</p>

        <p>The fear of technology has never been about machines. Like the Luddites of the past, modern "AI skeptics" fight change — but progress never asks for permission.</p>
