    <article>

      <p>Labor migration — and migration in general — is a topic everyone seems to be discussing today. Many countries pick it up for different reasons, often driven by political cycles, security concerns, or economic pressures. But if you look closely, the motivations of governments and political parties vary dramatically from place to place.</p>

      <p>In Russia, the issue is primarily about security. Without diving into politics, let’s stay within a business-analytic tone: Moscow has long relied on a massive number of labor migrants who performed work that the local population was not eager to take. Yet today the situation has shifted sharply — migrants are now being deported even at the expense of business needs or urban cleanliness. The priority has become security, not economic convenience.</p>

      <p>In the United States the story is even more complicated. In New York, starting from four in the morning, thousands of labor migrants — many of them undocumented — are already working. This is simply how the economy functions. Owners of small shops cannot afford full payroll, insurance, and benefits — the things local workers typically expect.</p>

      <p>Why U.S. authorities suddenly turned their attention to these workers is hard to explain in one sentence. It’s a mix of populism, fear of cultural dilution, a bit of xenophobia, and an unwillingness to admit that the average American will not work 12–15 hour shifts for wages below the official minimum.</p>

      <p>To be fair, the frustration of certain segments of American society toward migrants — legal or not — is understandable. The famous “melting pot” has worked remarkably well for newcomers, but far less so for parts of the native working class, who were hit by the consequences of globalization. When living standards fall and jobs disappear, people look for someone to blame. Migrant workers are visible; they work hard; and this alone irritates those who feel left behind.</p>

      <p>I lived in New York, in the Bay Ridge neighborhood — traditionally an Italian area. In the mid-1990s it saw a huge inflow of migrants from parts of South Asia. And very soon the neighborhood began to change sharply.</p>

      <p>Household waste mixed with the ashes of deceased relatives — part of a ritual intended to feed animals, which of course do not exist on New York streets — started being thrown directly onto sidewalks.</p>

      <p>In schools, children from newly arrived families would speak to teachers in ways completely unacceptable by local norms — it wasn’t unusual to hear “shut up, woman,” simply because they were copying communication patterns considered normal at home.</p>

      <p>There was clearly an overconcentration of people who did not assimilate but instead reshaped the neighborhood around themselves.</p>

      <p>Migration is always a balance between economic necessity, cultural boundaries, and political narratives. The problem isn’t migrants themselves — it’s the inability of states to manage inflows and expectations. When a city absorbs more people than its cultural and administrative systems can handle, tension becomes inevitable — whether in Moscow, New York, or anywhere else.</p>
