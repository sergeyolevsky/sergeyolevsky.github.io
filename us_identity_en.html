    <p>American political institutions are often viewed as stable and self-regulating: the separation of powers, federalism, the autonomy of the states, a developed electoral system, and judicial oversight. Yet the stability of a state depends not only on formal mechanisms, but also on the presence of a shared symbolic space within which these mechanisms are perceived as legitimate.</p>

    <p>For two centuries, American political culture rested on the idea of a common project — the notion that the state provides a framework for joint action among people with different interests and viewpoints. As long as this framework existed, political conflict remained internal and manageable. Today, this framework is under strain.</p>

    <h2>The Political Role of the State in Conservative Discourse</h2>
    <p>Since the second half of the twentieth century, conservative rhetoric has increasingly described the state as an external structure capable of limiting individual and economic freedom. This view does not necessarily imply a rejection of institutions, but it alters the perception of the state as a shared resource. When the state is experienced as something “other,” the outcomes of its procedures — including elections — can be interpreted not as part of a joint political process, but as something imposed. This lowers the perceived legitimacy of the political center without formally dismantling it.</p>

    <h2>The Shift in Liberal Cultural Politics</h2>
    <p>At the same time, liberal discourse has increasingly focused on identity-based cultural politics. Its goal is to recognize diversity, but it is accompanied by a symbolic elevation of the status of education, language, and cultural norms. As a result, a portion of the population finds itself not excluded from the political process, but excluded from symbolic recognition. Its participation in the common project ceases to be perceived as equal or equivalent.</p>

    <h2>The Break in the Shared Framework of Identity</h2>
    <p>These processes reinforce one another. Some groups begin to perceive the state as an apparatus of external control. Others perceive part of the population as not fully integrated into contemporary cultural norms. The political system remains formally unified, but the symbolic foundation of shared identity is no longer common.</p>

    <h2>The Threshold of a New “We”</h2>
    <p>The contemporary United States is not in a state of disintegration, but is undergoing a reconfiguration of political culture. The state remains institutionally unified, yet divided in its understanding of what constitutes the common project. The future will depend on whether American political culture can form a renewed language of shared future cooperation, or whether the fragmentation of identities will solidify as a long-term condition.</p>
